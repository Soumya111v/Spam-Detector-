This project aims to implement and design a Spam Detector which easily identifies whether the messages are SPAM  or not SPAM (HAM Messages) with the help of Navis Bayes Algorithm . 
Naive Bayes classifiers work by correlating the use of tokens (typically words, or sometimes other things), with spam and non-spam e-mails and then using Bayes' theorem to calculate a probability that an email is or is not spam.
